This is a MMO in a single web page. The page has a bunch of people on it.

The people affect each other. So, for example, being around religious right
people will make the gay people afraid.
So we have some set of expressions for each base face. Atop that, they move about in some Lennard-Jonesish way.
From time to time one of the people is highlighted. You're then in control of that person.
There's a set of buttons you can click to have 'your' person influence those around them.
So if you preach tolerance you increase the tolerance level of people around you, but also
make intolerant people move away from you.

implementation:

web page is served as swipl web page on pengines and jquery 

on the web page side we loop through the list of chars and get positions for them from the server via pengines first/next. We jquery animate divs so they are moving towards static position.

The divs contain face and expression IMG tags.

How bad does this hammer the server?  Need to do forall on server and return list.

On the server side every request also calls update_state/0
We pick n pairs of NPC's at random. Each has a state vector. We have some function of the two
state vectors that makes a new state vector for one of them.

We might need to have n adjust for the rate at which it's getitng called so game speed doesn't vary wildly with load.

alternatively, might be easier to just call some 'update gamestate' uri on a spawned thread

Pages - we need home page, main game page, and admin page to restart the game.
